Business development can consist of ideas, initiatives and activities aimed towards driving a business in a progressive path. It majorly involves increasing revenues, growth of the organization in the market, business expansion, increasing profitability by building strong network connections, industry relations, strategic partnerships, and making strategic business decisions.

Business development involves higher level decision-making on the foundation of a realistic assessment of all potential changes, consequences and their impact. Through new ideas and initiatives, business development aims to enhance overall business prospects, which drive the functioning of multiple business wings. Business development is more than just marketing, sales or revenue generation. It is the ecosystem that holds the entire business and its various divisions which drives the overall growth.

Since business development involves high-level decision making, business developers should remain informed about the following:

Present state of the business in terms of SWOT analysis
Present state of the overall industry and growth projections
Competitor developments
Primary sources of sales/revenues
Buyer Personas
New and unexplored market opportunities
New domains/products/sectors eligible for business expansion

Due to the wide open scope of business development and constantly evolving dynamic nature of the market, there are no standard practices and principles for this job role. From exploring new opportunities in various external markets, to introducing new methods for improved efficiency in internal business operations and developments, everything can fit under the business development umbrella. The ideas must be creative, realistic and feasible which is essential for any business development. It is also important to be flexible. Employees who are in charge with business development should be able to take constructive criticism and remember that it’s a process.

Business Development may be difficult but it can be easily understood using a working concept. A person who is ready to take up the role for business development needs to have an open mindset, willingness for an honest and realistic self assessment and the ability to accept failures. He/ She should be ready to accommodate change in order to achieve the best results.  For a successful business development, the end results matter the most than the ideation, implementation and execution of the plans.

Communication is not the transmission of the message or the message itself. It is a coherent exchange of understanding coming from the recipient. Communication requires successful business. Communication is the essence of management. Basic administrative tasks like planning, editing, performance, administration and control cannot be performed properly without active communication.

Business communication involves continuous data flow. Organizations these days are big and involve a large number of people. The larger the number of standards, the more difficult it becomes to manage an organization. Communication here plays a very important role in the process of directing and controlling people in organization. A quick response can be obtained as well as misunderstandings if anything can be avoided. There should be effective communication between the top and bottom of the organization, between the organization and the community as a whole (for example between management and trade unions). It is essential to the success and growth of an organization. Communication spaces should not appear in any organization.

Business Communication is based on purpose. Company rules, regulations and policies must be communicated to the public within the organization. Business Communication is governed by certain rules and procedures. In the early days, business communications were limited to paperwork, telecommunications etc. But now with the advent of technology, we have cell phones, video conferences, emails, and satellite communications to support business communications. Effective business communication helps to build a strong foundation for any organization.

The success of a business venture depends largely on good communication. Active communication clears barriers to achieving a business target. Failure to communicate can result in loss of money, time, energy, opportunity and business interest. In this age of globalization all businesses, large and small, need the right communication in order to exist. The success of any business venture depends largely on the effective communication. In this age of speed, mixing and competition, sending product-related information to a major consumer is very important. Unless they know about a business brand, they are unlikely to contact and purchase the product. Communication plays an important role in this field.

Entrepreneurship is a practice in which an individual sets ideas, efforts, and funds altogether to create his/her own empire. It has become a contemporary sensation amongst the youth. It is all about thinking, planning, operating and maintaining an idea. Entrepreneurs don't believe in salaries; they go for profits. Being an entrepreneur provides you with ample autonomy but at the same time, it comes with tons of responsibility.
An entrepreneur can be the one who wants to start his/ her own business and can also be the one who had set up a business earlier or is continuing with the family business. The former category may lack the experience aspect and the latter category may lack modern techniques. Therefore, comprehending the new market trends, target customer, and competitors isn’t easy. So, one should have an understanding of all the latest techniques and notable learning from the experience of experts. To entertain the latest opportunities and to tackle the threats quickly, an entrepreneur has to be a step ahead and should have a clear analysis of the market.

As the world is evolving rapidly, we are moving towards a self-reliant and independent mind-set. Likewise, we as a nation are also moving towards making our country self-reliant. In the process of becoming a self-sufficient society, our youth is thriving to be more empirical and are switching from the notion of "Do what is said" to "Do what you want". Entrepreneurs are the pillar of any economy and the start-up culture is becoming the new mania all around the world. A successful entrepreneur is the one who understands, accepts and learns every day. In ancient times, it was believed that entrepreneurs are born with those extraordinary entrepreneurial skills but we simply don't see ourselves on the same page with this theory because we believe there is nothing that one cannot learn. We have the back of each and every budding entrepreneur.

In simple words, a business plan is created when the entrepreneur identifies a problem and develops a solution to it. This may seem to be manageable but as you advance in your entrepreneurial venture you will come across several setbacks. At the end of the day, humans have limited ability and an entrepreneur is not expected to have knowledge of each and every aspect and element at the first day. Therefore, it is necessary to have the required knowledge before diving into the world of business. The business world has developed various techniques and methods with which you can understand the pros and cons of your business plan and can address them at the earliest.

We at Learnopad believe in providing our learners with the best of the best knowledge and rational guidance to enable them to conform to their vision. Our entrepreneurship courses provide valuable insights into the journey of creating a successful business. To turn a lean canvas into a sheer reality is an ambitious mission but if that furious intention is backed up with the expertise, proficiency and knowledge then undoubtedly success would be the outcome. Our courses are framed in a manner so that they provide you with knowledge about the latest analysis techniques, procedures and modern schemes. We focus on providing you real-time experience and learning so that you can easily gel with the tough market conditions in an incubated environment with us.

Human Resources have now become a default department of any and every organization. Men, materials, machinery and money play important role in businesses. Out of all these factors, manpower is considered as the most important factor. The significance of human factor in today’s modern corporate society can be judged from the viewpoint that is starting from recruitment to retention, learning, and development and then to leadership. Human Resources professionals are cornerstones of the system.

According to Lawrence A, “Management and personnel administration are one and the same. They should never be separated. Management is personnel administration”. Of all the tasks of management, managing the human factor is the central and most important task, because everything else depends on how well it is done.

As Organizations get larger, so does the demand for talented workforce. This in turn has led to more importance being placed on streamlining the procedures and compensation plans designed for them. The Human Resources department plays the major role in this regard and helps the organization achieve their goals effectively and efficiently.

It is the primary focus of HR professionals to identify talent, analyze training needs and plan on retention of the best employees. Leadership training focusing on the bigger picture and succession planning has become the recent trends in HR’s best practices. The personnel department helps management in using and developing appropriate manpower to achieve organizational goals.

The Importance of HRM and the Business Strategy

One of the essential elements that define strategic Human Resources Management (HRM) is its close relationship to the business’s main strategy. HRM driven by carefully crafted business strategy leads the path to economic progress and eventual success of the organization. According to Kochan and Dyer, HRM only becomes strategic when in private sector human resources (HR) are promoted to a position where the organization looks and treats them as a competitive advantage.

The creation of multiple new macro economies, re-thinking the importance of human factor at work have led to the recognition of people as a valuable asset which if managed as a strategic resource can help an organization to achieve superior performance levels and gain competitive advantage in the market. The heart of any organization is its workforce i.e., employees. Therefore, HRM has a definite strategic approach in aligning human resources with organizational goals and objectives and contributing to the best of potential to the organization and thus to the corporate ecosystem.

Effective management of human resources requires both scientific and human relations approaches. The emphasis should be equal on both goals of the organization and welfare of the employees. In order to effectively invest on the human resources, modern firms should institute humane employee relations policies, reviews on package offered, appraise performance regularly, build motivation-oriented culture and can introduce open channels to assist in participative management practices where employees are engaged during decision procedures.

Work starts as words on paper. These are all goals and objectives which are essential to any business endeavor. Initially, they were incorporated into the business plan to function as complex roadblocks. Both investors and founders can easily access and use the best capture on all moving parts of the company, such as staff, equipment and processes that increases the value of the organization.

Operations are designed to allow you to view everything and provide oversight in relation to the work of the organization. They assist by providing roles and responsibilities, managing risk, resources, and allocating and revealing the best course of action at all times. They are both direct and indirect, ensuring that the company stays within its budget and that departments work together effectively. This is where the theory ends and the practice begins; the point at which change is to be considered.

Probably the business in question is the product manufacturer. Depending on the product, the chain may be long or short. Depending on the default, the number of employees may vary. If a company sells its products through brick and mortar stores, it will need the right environment - to increase sales but also respect the rules, while if it is involved in eCommerce, the business will need the right software. These are just a few of the factors that may influence business performance in a company. Jobs are also changing as the business grows. While it is common practice for a small company for one person to take on additional responsibilities, the same is not true for larger ones. The business activity should appear next to the organization, or getting caught up in the system will enhance their presence. If there is too much pressure left on one person’s shoulders, then there will be mistakes and omissions almost unavoidable. This, in turn, tends to accumulate and will lead to other similarities, creating a destructive domino effect. It is up to all departments to adjust and perform business functions to keep pace with the growth of the company.

The success or failure of a company depends largely on the efficiency. But what are these processes for? What can participants expect from the right process and appropriate action? Alternatively, they can expect to increase the value of their company. This is done for profit. Increase in prices are affected by how well the business performs financially, i.e. on shares, interest and all refunds. If this return is greater than the investment, the profit is registered. If a company is able to turn its profits into overtime, its value increases significantly.
To register a profit, a company must carefully evaluate the market. Often, a high-value business or service will be the enlightenment for its competitors. The company's investment in its product or service should also be considered. If the demand is high, if we can afford it, if the product is below demand, the business can really succeed.

Project Management is the process of initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and closure. It is a team working together to accomplish goals within the specified time. Project Management in simple terms, mainly involves expertise within the fields of: what to do, when to try, the way to do and within what budget. Project Management deals with a project in 6 different phases, also referred to as the project life cycle. Now, let’s look at the 6 phases -

Initiation
Initiation is the first step for checking the feasibility of the project and measuring its worth.
Planning
The Planning phase involves making a blueprint for achieving the project’s objectives.
Execution
The Execution phase involves the allocation of resources and making of the deliverables.
Monitoring
The Monitoring phase involves the project manager in monitoring and controlling the working of the project by the team.
Closure
The closure is at the end of the project, where everything including what went wrong and what went right during the method is summed up.

Good project management will result in achieving the specified result especially if there are tons of challenges and changes a corporation goes through. Everyone can keep track of what's happening and that they can manage to satisfy deadlines and budgets. There are a spread of characteristics or "skills" that are essential within the practice of Project Management. Outlined below are a number of the talents every effective Project Manager should possess within their utility belt:

Leadership Skills - When leading a project you must be able to clearly convey the vision, the project goals and the overall objectives of the organization.
Scope Management Skills - Scope Management is a practice which describes the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully. The management portion is performed during the project initiation phase, where you'd outline and plan the scope, create the scope definition, scope verification, and scope change control.
Relationships Building - Just like in your lives, trust and respect are two of the most important foundations for any relationship. Creating these building blocks are key traits of a leader to possess. Teams won't perform unless they trust the project manager and therefore the organization, and feel they're trusted. Trust will encourage people to propose ideas, suggest ways to reinforce work, speak of their concerns about the project and provide solid honest advice.
Excellent "Active" Listening Skills - It is essential to understand the scope of your project. A Project Manager (PM) needs to have the capacity to listen to the needs of the person or organization. A PM's objective is to deliver the final product or service to the satisfaction of the owner also known as the "stakeholder" or "owner."
Time Management Skills - As all projects are temporary, this is often a crucial skill within the practice of Project Management to manage some time effectively. Every project consists of tasks, deliverables, roles, and responsibilities. A Project Manager is usually playing a balancing act between the infamous triangle consisting of Scope, Time, and Cost.
Risk Management Skills - There is risk with every project but within Project Management, managing risk is vital to any successful project. The fundamental definition of risk management is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of unfortunate events or to maximise the belief of opportunities.

The internet and computers are changing our lives by improving the efficiency of our day to day chores. This modern age is referred to as technology age or IT (Information Technology) age because of the ease of flow of information. The world has become smaller by this and businesses have reached high ambitions as they never thought they would. Efficiency of operation has also increased with time as the availability of resources lately has been too adequate.

Technology has been revolving around our world and daily lives. It has created various platforms and made things more accessible for people around the world with just one click. With the revolving technology, our lives have turned faster, easier, quicker and better as we can have all the information needed with just a bit of surfing through the net. Talking about Digital life, it will expand more and escape the boundaries set by people.

We have advanced the world with something called Artificial intelligence. It is impacting the future virtually along with every industry and every human being.  Artificial intelligence has been one of the main drivers of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and much more. It will continue to improve more technology in the future.

It basically is a thought to refer to “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, given the human capacity for judgment and intention”. The biggest breakthroughs for Artificial Intelligence research in recent years have been in the field of machine learning, in particular within the field of deep learning. Especially for formulaic articles like earnings reports or sports statistics, AI has increasingly been used to automatically write stories and fill in different data. Today, we use AI in our day to day lives. From booking a cab to flying in an airplane, AI is used everywhere and has surrounded the world within its performances. Flying a plane on Auto Pilot can be the best example for AI used over years efficiently. If the world grows in the same speed and the technologies keep scrutinizing themselves with such pace then, AI will start leading our lives to its maximum power. Not only it will guide us but it will start creating its own existence through its advancements and will be a part of our daily living.
This field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate itself also. AI techniques have become a part of the technological industry, helping to solve many challenges in computer science, software engineering, and operations research.

The science of extracting insights from structured and unstructured data through various means such as scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge is known as Data Science. It is related to mining of data and analytics of data. It is a basic concept to unify statistics, machine learning, domain knowledge, and their related methods to understand and analyse the actual phenomena and involves a plethora of expertise to generate a redefined look for information.

A combination of every possible skill, from solving maths problems till analysing the accuracy of data, a data scientist must comprise all required to fulfil the complete pack in order to become a data scientist. Even visualising and interpreting a certain amount of data is required at some point of time. To derive innovations and efficiency of work, in this field one must have the proper skills required because there is no assurance of secure data once it's online. So, the person must be always careful about what is being posted and have an overview of what already has been done.

Data scientists have artificial intelligence (AI) as their backbone; especially its subdivisions of machine learning and deep learning to introduce new models and make certain assumptions using algorithms. It has led to a number of breakdowns in the various industries. With the vast availability of networks these days, everything has become faster and easier to explore and work through, as it is feasible to connect across the world and grasp the changes required.

Database is also known as electronic database. It is an organized collection of data or information that is used for rapid search and retrieval of information by a computer. These are designed to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in conjunction with a number of processing operations. A database management system (DBMS) pulls information from the database as a response to queries.

A database is stored as a set of systematic records. Different fields are described to store different kinds of data and each field contains information connecting to one aspect or attribute of the entity given by the database. Numerous fields of the same database have a link between each field so as to make the data clear to the person executing it.

Using various ways provided by the servers or platforms they store their database on, the users can easily retrieve, edit, search, replace and perform many operations even in a particular field of data.
Each database records and files must be organized for the retrieval of information. The main way of retrieving database information is through queries. The power of a database management system (DBMS) comes from its ability to define new relationships from the basic ones given by the database tables and use them to get responses to queries. For example, a user provides a string of characters searching for a particular query and the computer searches the database for a corresponding sequence and provides the source materials in which those characters appear.

Large businesses/ companies and other organizations build up many independent files containing related and overlapping data. Their data processing activities requires the linking of data from several files. There are several different types of DBMS developed to support these requirements.
The different types of Database Management System are flat, hierarchical, network, relational, and object-oriented.

Everything has a process and a unit to perform. Similarly even databases collect information and needs these types of information to curate them through the important ones. Database Management Systems is an in demand course is this era because data is everything. One should know how to handle a database. There is a separate subject for Database Management Systems.

Ecommerce, also known as electronic commerce refers to the buying and selling of products through internet. Looking at the needs of today’s generation, no one really gets time to invest in moving out and looking for what they actually want. Ecommerce is the commercial way of purchasing and selling of goods using online mode to undergo payment process. Basically, it refers to every means of purchase that takes place online. Contradicting to e-business, e-commerce is just defined by the use of buying and selling of products through any online medium.

NetMarket was the first American retail platform to undergo this online sale when a man sold a CD to his friend through his website. This was the first example of a consumer buying a product from a business through World Wide Web (WWW). Call it a consumer web service or a platform for exchanging goods; independent workers, a very small scale business owner as well as larger companies have been benefited by this source with a very reasonable rate of trade that would have never been possible offline. Since the very first trade, e-commerce has developed and expanded all over and has gained almost a number one popularity in terms of convenience, reliability, market standards and most importantly trade.

This permits customers to overcome geographical barriers and allows them to purchase with their own convenience. Traditional markets have an end number of strategies for conducting business. There is huge difference in trading the product offline vs. trading it online. Traditional retailers set their target prices on store traffic and the cost to keep the rates inventory. Online retailers set their target prices on the speed of delivery. Most of the people prefer online markets as the products can be delivered quickly at relatively low price than the traditional retailers.

Online retailers cannot go through the physical experience that traditional retailers can. It can be difficult to judge the quality of a product without the physical experience, which may cause customers to be in a dilemma of their purchase. Making an online transaction is another story everyone goes through, as you never know when the network gets improper and you face issues. But then online platforms assure the security of the payment made.

Computer hardware is the material that a computer program needs. It covers everything with a circuit board that works inside a PC or laptop; including motherboard, graphics card, CPU (Central processing unit), air fans, webcam, power delivery and more. Although Hardware configurations differ between desktop PCs and laptops due to their differences in size, similar key components will be found in both. Without Hardware, there would be no way to use the essential software that makes computers so useful. Software is defined as operating systems on your computer; that is, an application, an Internet browser, word processing documents, etc. Although a computer can only work if both software and software work together, the speed of the program will depend largely on the hardware used.
Computer hardware is a term used to describe any physical components of an analog or digital computer. Computer hardware still separates the physical features of a computer device from software, which contains written instructions that tell the genes what to do. Computer hardware can be classified as having internal or external components. Internal components include things like motherboard, central process unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), hard drive, optical drive, heat exchanger, power transmission, transistors, chips, repair unit graphics (GPU), network communication card (NIC) and Universal seri Bus (USB) ports. These components work in conjunction with or maintain the instructions provided by the system or operating system (OS).
External components, also called computer components, are those that are constantly connected to a computer to control input or output. Typical input components include a mouse, keyboard, microphone, camera, touch screen, sticker, toy stick, scanner, USB flash drive or memory card. Monitors, printers, speakers, headphones and earphones are all examples of productive computer components. All of these Hardware devices are designed to provide instructions to the software or to provide results from its use. While it is not uncommon for individuals or businesses to purchase a computer, then upgrade or upgrade it, there is also the possibility of renting it physically and visually from a service provider. The provider will be responsible for keeping the hardware up to date, both depending on its various features and the software it operates on.
 Either way, if the Hardware is damaged or expired, MSP is responsible for removing it and replacing it. Depending on the terms of the SLA, the extract may include transaction data, physically distribute hard drives and ensure that the old equipment is legally reused.Explore more on your field of interests, get connected with us on LEARNOPAD.

Internet of Things (IoT) is the ability to transfer data to a network without the need for human or human interaction or computer. In short, IoT is the concept of connecting all devices to the internet. Explore more about your interests and the role you think you can go through in an accessible platform like LearnOpad. As the Internet of Things (IoT) allows devices to be remotely controlled across the internet, it is creating opportunities to connect the physical world to computer-based applications using sensors and the internet. It incorporates technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, and smart transportation.

The main benefits of IoT are:
Improved Customer Engagement - IoT enhances the customer experience by making the action automated. For example, any problem in the car will be automatically detected by the sensors. The driver, along with the manufacturer will be notified. Until the driver arrives at the service station, the manufacturer will ensure that the faulty part is found at the service station.
Technical Optimization - IoT has helped a lot in improving technology and making it better.
Reduced Pollution - Our current understanding is superior, but IoT provides real-time information that leads to decision-making and resource management. For example, if a manufacturer finds fault with multiple engines, he/she can track the production plant of these engines and can fix the issue with the production belt.

Machine learning enables computers to do the things that humans have done, so far. From driving a car to translating speech, machine learning drives the explosion in the power of artificial intelligence, helping the software programs that help this world to become a better place. Machine learning is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gives systems the ability to automate learning and development from experience without explicit programming.

Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it for self-study. At the highest level, machine learning is the process of teaching a computer program how to make accurate predictions when entering data. It all starts with training a machine learning model, a mathematician who is able to re-change how it works until you are able to make accurate predictions when you are given new data.

Before the start of training, you should first choose what information you should collect and decide which data features are important. Currently, electronic learning is used in many fields and industries. For example, medical diagnosis, image processing, prediction, classification, reading, etc.

Machine learning involves finding computers to learn how to do tasks without having a clear plan to do so. It involves learning about computers from the data provided so that they can perform specific tasks. With simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to set up algorithms that tell the machine how to use all the necessary steps to solve an existing problem; on the other side of the computer, no reading is required. With highly advanced functions, it can be challenging for a person to manually perform the required algorithms. With practice, it may appear that it would be more effective to help a machine build its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify all the necessary steps.

Machine learning instruction uses a variety of methods to teach computers to perform tasks where there is no algorithm that is completely satisfactory. In cases where there are a lot of possible answers, one way is to include records of other relevant answers as applicable. This can be used as computer training data to improve the algorithm it uses to find the right answers.

Machine Learning is one of the top demanding courses in this era where robots have become the new trend-setter. LearnOpad has a list of courses in this category related to Robotics for learners. Learners can choose whatever they want to learn from the industry experts. We conduct live sessions for better interaction between facilitators and our learners.

  Network and Security contains certain policies and procedures that are adopted to protect and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or declining the computer network and its access resources. Network security includes network access authorization, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users choose or are assigned an ID and password or other verification information that allows them to access information and applications under their jurisdiction.

  Network security includes a variety of public and private networks that are used in day-to-day operations which conduct transactions and communications between businesses, government agencies and individuals.

  Networks may be private, such as within a company, and others may be open to public access. Network security is involved in organizations, businesses and other types of institutions. It does as its title suggests: protecting the network, as well as protecting and monitoring activities. A common and easy way to protect a network device is by providing a unique name and a corresponding password.

  As this requires only one username authentication information - e.g. Password - this is sometimes called one-factor authentication. For two-factor authentication, something the user 'has' is used (e.g., security token or 'dongle', ATM card, or mobile phone); and with three-factor authentication, something the user is not 'in' is also used (e.g., fingerprint or visual scanning).
  Once verified, the firewall presses accessibility policies such as which services are allowed for network users.

  Even though it is effective in preventing unauthorized access, this may not be able to detect potentially harmful content such as computer worms or Trojans transmitting on the network. Injury detection-based detection systems may also detect a network such as wire shark traffic and may be installed for recent high-level testing and analysis purposes. There are new techniques that include unattended machine learning and full traffic analysis which can detect active network attackers from malicious attackers or targeted external attackers.

  Do you want to learn networking and security? There are various jobs related to these which are of great demand. During pandemic situations where people have to rely on working with PC’s and laptops, there is a need for a high network and security for companies and businesses.

The operating system acts as a mediator between the computer user and the computer hardware. The purpose of the app is to provide a place where the user can make programs in a simple and appropriate way. An operating system is a software that controls computer resources. Every computer system must provide an appropriate mechanism to ensure the smooth operation and protect user systems from interfering with the system operation.

It is a part of a computer program that is responsible for managing and coordinating the activities and sharing of computer resources. The OS acts as the developer of machine-run applications. As a host, one of the purposes of the OS is to manage hardware performance data. This reduces app settings from managing this data and makes it easier to write programs. Almost all computers use an OS of some kind.

Operating Systems offers many services to applications and users. Applications access these services through Application Program Interfaces (APIs) or system calls. By using this compensation, the app can request a service from the OS, approve the parameters, and obtain performance results. Users can also communicate with the OS by typing instructions or using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). All computers must have an application to run other programs. An operating system combines the use of computer hardware between different system programs and operating systems for different users. It simply provides a place where other programs can do useful work.

An operating system is a set of special programs that run on a computer system that allows it to run smoothly. It performs basic functions such as seeing input from the keyboard, tracking files and disks on disk, sending out-screen displays and managing related devices. The OS is designed to serve two basic purposes and that controls the distribution and use of computer system resources among users of various functions and provides communication between computer hardware and software that simplifies and facilitates coding, creating, debugging application programs.

Examples of Operating System are -
Windows (GUI based, PC)
GNU / Linux (Personal, workplaces, ISP, file and print server, third party / client)
MacOS (Macintosh) used for personal computers and workstations
Android (Google Operating System for phones / tablets / smartwatches)
IOS (Apple's OS for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch)

People out there! If you think that with increasing age or during adulthood you are losing the power of memorising the work and things then you are probably wrong.

“Be steady and well-ordered in your life so that you can be fierce and original in your work”
Gustave Flaubert

Well stated quote in this era where people work knowing the fact that they might ignore the basic and key essence of life.

It is a recommendation for our dear learners not to ignore the other aspects of life while you are working. Usually, the new generation people are unable to adjust and prioritise their work and face many issues related to personality development. They sometimes culminate health issues which they cannot afford while working too. We don’t want you to fall in this trap and this why we have got the best courses for you under this category where you will explore the ways to manage work life and private life and also know the ways to prioritise the work assigned to you. Most importantly, you will come across a drastic change in your life which will not only bring stability to you but will also provide you with well-being and calmness on and off the work.

Work life balance is a common term used by everyone today where an individual describes the balance in simple words ‘the work and time allotted to different other aspects of life which includes leisure activities, social and family activities etc.’

During the courses under this category with LearnOpad, you will discover the ability you have hidden inside yourself to prioritise work. We will make you acquaint with the process of improvising your work life balance because for most of the people there is no significance of work life balance and this results in their deterioration that may be in their mental or physical development.

By the end of the course you will be more productive, enhanced credibility, delegate work and will be a perfect time and action manager. For this course, you don’t need any prerequisites but just a good internet connection, no background noise for you to understand and concentrate better so that, our experienced facilitators can connect with you more easily.

All in all, work life balance is not hard to accomplish with LearnOpad when all you need is determination, registration, enrolment and good internet connection. We will guide you throughout with our fun-filled projects and assignments to check your cognitive abilities every now and then to know you better.

    In today’s society, wanting to look boring and fun, women turn to makeup. Some just wear makeup regardless of the event. To get someone's appearance in an attractive way, make-up is something or things they use. Our cosmetic world originated a thousand years ago. The ancient Egyptians used clues and copper to create original cosmetics. As technology advanced, the cosmetics industry also developed into a wide range of cosmetic products. Although make-up can cover skin blemishes, acne and cracks, women no longer need to wear it because it damages the skin, and the cosmetics contain carcinogens and toxins that are harmful to a woman's health.

There is no makeup that reflects the natural beauty of a woman. That's the truth! Not only will it show its natural beauty, but with it, it will show its simplicity, and the kind of world-class personality. It creates a tectonic impression on others when women are confident, or do not use makeup. A person is not forced to wear makeup in order to look beautiful and attractive. Despite the need to use makeup, a woman can still appreciate herself.

Cosmetics form a range of products that are used to care for the face and body or to enhance or alter the appearance of the face or body. There is a huge list of cosmetics available. Each sub-category of cosmetics has its own characteristics; however products are usually made using a mixture of chemical elements derived from natural or intricately constructed sources. Cosmetics have at least three purposes - they can be used for cleansing, such as shampoo, body and face washes. They can be used to rejuvenate to protect the skin such as toners, serums, moisturizers and oils or they may be used to enhance a person's appearance, such as makeup. Often a progressive appearance may be due to cleansing or treating the body.

Beauty is the identification of a property or character in a person, object, animal, place or idea that provides complete information of happiness or satisfaction. Beauty is studied as part of aesthetics, culture, social psychology and social science. It often involves the interpretation of balance and harmony with nature, which can lead to feelings of attraction and emotional well-being. This experience of beauty is often said that "beauty is the eye of the beholder."

Dance is a powerful force, but the art of dance is what the talented dancers are forced into something very revealing and can delight viewers. These two concepts of dance art - dance as a dynamic compulsion and dance as an artfully embellished art made by a few professionals are two of the most important connecting concepts that apply to any consideration of the story. With dance, the connection between the two ideas is stronger than one art and it cannot exist without the other.

One of the basic purposes of dance is to express and communicate emotions. Humans, even some of the higher animals often dance as a way to release powerful emotions, such as a sudden onset of high spirits, excitement, patience, or anger. These basic targets are seen not only in the tricks, but the jumps that often take place in times of emotional turmoil, but also in the formal movements of “set,” such as nationalistic dance moves or elaborate dances. Here, dance helps to produce emotion and release them.

People also dance with the joy of discovering the body and the environment in new and special ways. Dance often involves excessive movement, for example, with the arms outstretched, the head held high, and the body bent or twisted. Also, it often involves a special effort or style, such as a high kick, a jump, or a walk. Dance movements are usually organized into a space pattern or rhythm, following lines or circles in the ground, following a certain sequence of steps, or conforming to a pattern of frequency or normal pressure.

All of these factors may reflect a different attitude and body. Dance requires unusual patterns of exercise and rest as well as unusual or continuous use of energy. The dancer can see a lot of gravity and in the form of balance that indicates that normal activities are not constructive. At the same time, the dance creates a very different impression of time and place: the time is marked by the rhythm of the movement and time of the dance, and the space is arranged around the dances of the dancer or around the body-shaped shapes.

Learning dance is an art. People dance with passion and some take it as a profession. You can have a natural talent of dancing but learning and practicing more makes a man perfect. At LearnOpad, we conduct dance courses for learners who are passionate about dancing. We offer various customized courses for learners and even conduct live sessions between the facilitators and the learners which will be of a great advantage for our Learnopad learners.

Healthy eating should be an enjoyable experience for the community. When children and young people eat and drink well, they get all the nutrients they need to grow well and develop, and they have good food and other social skills. Healthy eating is not about cutting food - it's about eating a variety of foods at reasonable amounts to give your body what it needs. There are no single foods you should eat or menus that you need to make to eat healthy. You just need to make sure you get the right balance of different foods. Healthy foods for children and young people should always include a list of delicious and tasty foods that can make healthy, varied and balanced foods, rather than denying certain foods and beverages. Although all foods can be included in a healthy diet, this will not be the case for specialist / medical diets.

Getting a balanced and varied diet is an important step towards health and happiness. Vitamins and minerals in a diet are important to promote a healthy development. A healthy diet can protect the human body from certain diseases, especially from non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, other cancers and bone diseases. A healthy diet can also contribute to adequate body weight.

Healthy eating is a great opportunity to enrich health by experimenting with different foods from different cultures, origins and different ways of preparing food. The benefits of eating a variety of foods also affect emotions, for variety and color are important ingredients in a balanced diet. It is good for growth and a balanced diet is important for children and young people. As the body grows it is important to get the right nutrients so that the cells can be built and maintained and the body can grow at the right speed. Healthy eating also improves your appearance. Good nutrition contributes to healthy skin and texture and is “light” that makes you look younger.

  Health and fitness are two concepts that go hand in hand. Our health is the totality of our physical, mental and emotional well-being. Fitness, on the other hand, is a state of control over our body. Thus, we could be physically, mentally and emotionally fit. Consequently, health and fitness can be regarded as a way to attain control over our body.

  Good health means that a person is physically and mentally strong; fitness refers to the ability of the person to encounter the demands of the environment. This will help you in being both mentally and bodily fit to some extent. Exercises and other forms of workouts like dancing, yoga, etc., are the best ways to keep yourself fit and these practices will also, in turn, help you to be calm and composed.

  Health and fitness play a major role in keeping you and the people around you happy as well as healthy. Health and fitness can be maintained through regular workouts, healthier food, and other healthier habits.

  Fitness is a process that requires proper understanding. Health and fitness is something that someone has to have a purpose and stick to it in order to be successful at it. It is a challenge to remain healthy and fit because of the commitment it requires and the work that has to be done. Accepting the challenge is the first step into health and fitness. It is also important to find a partner with whom you can exercise with. It is something you can do with your spouse or a colleague at work just for motivation. A workout schedule can be formulated together with a dietary schedule to maintain good health and be fit.

  Physical fitness involves the burning of unnecessary fat in our bodies which helps to reduce the cholesterol in our blood. Having less cholesterol in the body reduces the chances of developing high blood pressure. Also, when exercising, we use up the calories in our bodies and therefore, blood glucose is maintained at normal levels and thus reduces the chances of developing diabetes. It is also important to remain healthy and fit in order to maintain normal body weight.

  Therefore, if you want your life to be healthy and make yourself fit, you should really hit that button and register yourself with LearnOpad because it is you who has to run after health and not health after you and we know that you really don’t want to stand in that line of unhealthy people. Have a great learning experience with LearnOpad!

Food is anything that can be eaten to provide healthy body support. Foods are usually plant-based or animal-derived which contains essential nutrients such as proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, or minerals. The drug is absorbed by the organ and is absorbed into body cells to provide energy, maintain health, or stimulate growth.

The importance of food is obvious and important. Healthy food gives us the nutrients and strength to develop and grow, to be active and healthy, to move, play, work, think and learn. Food is directly related to our body, mental and social health because each food or liquid contains certain nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, fats, etc., which are essential for our physical and mental growth. Food and water are the main sources of healthy body and mind.

When we do not eat the right food, it leads to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Therefore, you should choose healthy and balanced foods that can provide healthy amounts of nutrients. We all know that food is very important and we eat it in our daily lives. Food affects our bodies and our mental and social health because each food or liquid contains certain nutrients that are important for our physical and mental development. Whenever we take any healthy food or fluid, our bodies digest and consume simple but essential nutrients and water from these healthy foods or liquids and convert that into the bloodstream and energy that helps our body grow and stay healthy. The food we take from our healthy diet act as fats to produce energy for mitochondria. Glucose in the diet interacts with oxygen to form energy, carbon dioxide, and water molecules. Our body uses the use of food to produce driving energy to keep the lungs breathing heart beating and the functioning of the legs.

Beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. In addition to their basic function of thirst to satisfy, beverages play an important role in human culture. Common types of beverages include plain drinking water, milk, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, juice and soft drinks.

We all have different taste, appearance and character. One thing which we all have in common is Mental Health. Unfortunately, this is one of the things which have been overlooked again and again. Today our lifestyle has transformed completely and has evolved to a fast track style which has to lead to distress and complications in our lives. It is not only degrading our physical health but also has given rise to certain serious mental ailments. Mental illness is when your state of mind is not at peace. Mental health is of the utmost significance in everybody's life.

Life was never easy and life will never be easy but with each passing day, we are becoming less humane to ourselves. We tend to be so hard on ourselves that it abuses our mental peace. When the fundamental part of the body is not stable then it will further adversely affect our physical health. All this originate out of grief and distasteful situations. This kind of illness not only affects an individual today but the impact of this can also be felt at the later stages of life. However, we never gave the required importance to our mental health. We just attempt to ignore and to hope that it will be healed miraculously.

Mental health problems can not only affect physically but can also ruin an individual's personal life and career because when our mind and soul is not at peace internally then it will definitely affect our external life.

We are emotional & expressive living beings and our anguishing behaviour tends to increase toil and worsens the condition. However, looking at the prevailing situation, it can be made out that we are moving towards a better tomorrow. With each passing day, our concern towards our mental health is improving. People are now becoming outspoken about such issues and are not uneasy to disclose the problems that they are facing.

Physical health is a state of physical, physiological healthiness through maintaining physical activity. We know that maintaining regular physical activity is one of the best ways to keep our bodies healthy. Besides, it also improves our overall well-being and quality of life. An unhealthy lifestyle and lack of exercise can take a toll on a person’s physiology. Physical inactivity will result to an increased risk for different types of cancer, numerous chronic diseases, and mental health issues. Exercise has shown to improve mood and mental health.

Here are a few ways of physical activity that can help you feel better and live better:

It’s a natural mood lifter –
Constant physical activity can relieve stress, anxiety, depression and anger. Maintaining physical activity is the one stop solution to lead a healthy life. It comes with no side effects! It in fact offers health and well-being more than we know and notice. People become better and feel better when physical activity becomes a regular part of their lives.

It keeps you physically fit and able -
Without regular activity, your body loses its strength and ability to function properly. When we do not utilize the strength we have or stay back from activity, our abilities perish. Exercise enhances core strength, which in turn increases your ability to do physical activities and stay active all day. Regular physical activity from a young age makes late-adulthood life easy and less prone to age related health issues.

It helps keep the doctor away -
One of the benefits of exercise and maintaining our health is that, it boosts our immunity and keeps us away from easily transmissible virus and bacteria. This way, we can give more time, energy and efforts to work, family and recreation.

Being more active can help you:
Lower your blood pressure
Boosts levels of good cholesterol
Burns bad cholesterol
Enhances blood circulation
Prevent bone loss and osteoporosis

All of this can add up to fewer medical expenses, interventions and medications later in life!
Encourage your family and friends to be more active, and challenge yourself to meet daily or weekly physical activity goals. Today the world is moving away from the western culture of hitting gyms and yoga is becoming the new life style. For fruitful outcomes in long run and sustainable lifestyle, we need to understand what suits us the best and inculcate it as a routine.

Apart from exercise, one can play outdoor sports with the whole family, schedule time each day inculcate hobbies like hiking or cycling. Make exercise and physical activity a permanent part of your daily routine and lifestyle. Being healthy is the new cool. Check out the courses our LearnOpad offers to keep you fit and fine.

  Life is unpredictable and that is a small thing. You often do not have any indication as to when your life will be lost. You will never know if you will end up running tomorrow and chances you think your neighborhood is 100% safe and nothing unbearable can happen to you in such a place. But many think the same and pay with their own lives. That’s why it’s important to take the basics of self-defense first.
  Self-defense and the various courses that transfer training are important for the following reasons –

  Self-confidence -
  Many people think that enrolling in a defense course should be deceptive, but there is more to it than just learning defensive technology. This is where the philosophy begins in these lessons that will teach you to raise your self-esteem levels so that you can carry anyone.

  Develop a personality -
  These lessons are in line with your belief system in addition to what you believe in and in that love, they make your personality grow by allowing you to explore your boundaries. While focusing that the classroom will still protect you, the training gives you better confidence and this will have a positive impact on your personality.

  Focus -
  One of the most important aspects of your training related to equity and focus is both are an important part of your training. Without the required balance or focus, you will not be in a position to take on anyone which is why it makes so much sense to learn to balance and focus well before you go on to learn defensive measures.

  Improves Endurance -
  Focusing endurance is important as this can help you to achieve better growth and overcome the various challenges you will face. Also, one of the hallmarks of hard training is when you learn to endure.

  Physical Condition -
  The point of any defense class is to make sure you are able to defend yourself successfully against anyone. And part of the lesson is to put you in a rigid routine that puts you physically and mentally able to carry your opponent, without the stress of the same.

  Self-awareness -
  As you continue to train, one of the great benefits of self-defense learning is that you gain more inclination and position and as a result, you know more. There is nothing better than knowing that you can take care of yourself mentally, financially, and physically. Yet for most people, the only part of the body involved is exercise. Being able to defend one in all situations is confidence.

  That confirmation can only be obtained with any type of self-defense courses. Here, at LearnOpad, we have courses related to self-defense. You can learn these courses with ease from the comfort of your home. You can even customize your courses like you want. At Learnopad, we consider our learners comfort very much so that even during critical situations, you don’t have to come to the physical class to learn self-defense. This is why we are here!

    The importance of sports is one of those topics that can be emphasized enough and for a good reason. Exercise is not only good for you, it is important if you want to stay healthy for the rest of your life. Every phase of life has its limitations but thankfully people have found exercise tips that will go with almost anyone. Modern man is placed in an urban environment that limits his mobility and restricts his ability to use the body to the fullest. If you look at the construction of cities historically, Homo sapiens have been around for a hundred thousand years and besides we have lived in the surrounding cities (city) for the last 10,000 years.

     Mankind was leading an immoral life-style most of its existence and this certainly made our bodies destined for certain things. This is not just a point to consider but a real fact that shows the importance of sports which has health effects on humans. The human body needs regular exercise because we tend to eat more than our modern and urban living needs. Therefore, we always find the strength to build up over time and cause various health problems. On the other hand, recent research indicates that regular physical activity helps the body regulate its homeostasis by releasing certain hormones that produces due to stressful human activity.

    Another introduction to sports is a healthy mind. Recent research on mental illness shows the importance of sports in treating general depression, anxiety, and addiction-related disorders. Thanks to the hormone endorphin which helps the body regain its production of serotonin and dopamine through cortical inhibition. That may sound complicated but the fact that the body responds in the same way as it responds to antidepressants or loading, therefore, helps to stimulate certain areas of the brain. Exercise is not only good as a form of disease prevention; it can also work as a medicine.

    Everything that is right for you can hurt you if the dosage is not right and the same rule applies in sports. It can help you get better and change you into a healthier person but if you exercise too much, it will damage your body. After an entire period of strenuous physical exercise, the body needs time for rest and treatment. Modern forms of exercise such as gymnastics place great strain on certain muscle groups and cause them to lose weight faster. If you want your muscles to be strong, you will word hard but if you work continuously without resting the body, it will stop building and will be damaged.
    All in all, sports are a great way to help your body control itself in an urban environment where we are not using our bodies properly. As with most other things in life you have to maintain a positive attitude, stay positive and get the right balance and everything will be fine.

The term ‘Yoga’ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Yuj’, known as union. It signifies the union of the mind and the body to achieve peace and harmony. Yoga is a methodical effort to control the different elements of human nature related to physical and psychical. Yoga and meditation have both become increasingly popular in this digital world, and practitioners praise their psychological and physical benefits after practicing it. The current scientific research suggests that meditating and doing yoga during early morning can boost overall well-being of a person.

If practiced and followed regularly, yoga and meditation can give progressive results that can be fruitful. Scientific research studies have revealed that yoga and meditation essentially have a biochemical effect on the human body that resembles the benefits of anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications and thus, can help a lot of people to relieve tension and stress.

Strength and endurance are essential for youngsters who have to stay active and multitask all day. Yoga and meditation increases muscle and core strength. Various yoga poses such as plank and variations in it improves the upper body strength. In yoga, different breathing techniques improve the breathing mechanism and reduce fatigue levels. Lower back muscles are strengthened by practicing poses like chair pose.

A proper practice of yoga exercise prepares the body and the mind of yoga practitioner to make spiritual progress. The spiritual aspect is basically the control of the mind and self-development through direct control of the inner energy, i.e., pranayam. Pranayam is one of the most important features of yoga that is mainly concentrated on the regulation of ‘breath’ when one inhales air from one part of the nose and exhales it from the other.

In this modern era, yoga has evolved as an alternative system of medicine. Each year, more and more people are practicing it effectively and reaping its benefits. Systematic practice of yoga helps in inculcating discipline too. Moreover, it is not expensive; neither does it have side effects. On the contrary, allopathic ways of treatment is costly and carry side effects. The best time for a yoga schedule and pranayam is early morning during sunrise with fresh air while birds chirp. Moreover, during this time, the mind and body feel fresh after a successful sleep cycle. Doctors too suggest that morning is the best time for yoga and exercise. Yoga also helps us realize our body has a dignity of its own and so does the mind.

                                                Engineering, the application of science to the right evolution of natural resources is used by humanity. The field has been defined by the Engine Development Council, in the United States, as the use of “scientific methods to design or develop buildings, equipment, or production processes, or to operate them efficiently or in combination; or to build or use the same with full recognition of their construction; or to predict their conduct under certain working conditions; all in terms of targeted work, economics that works and safety in health and property”. The word ‘engineering’ is sometimes described in more detail, especially in Great Britain, such as the manufacture or assembly of engines, machine tools, and machine parts.

Engineers design, develop, modify, install, test and maintain a wide range of products and systems. They also recommend and set up building materials and processes, direct production and construction, conduct failure analysis. They also provide consultation services and teach engineering courses at colleges and universities.

The engineering field is divided into a number of specialized areas:

1.Mechanical engineering involves the design, production, inspection and repair of machinery, equipment and building materials as well as control systems and equipment to assess their condition and performance. These include automotive, construction and farm equipment, industrial installations and a variety of tools and equipment.
2.Electrical engineering involves the design, manufacturing, controlling, monitoring and testing of electrical and electronic equipments, machineries and systems. These systems vary from microscopic circles to national power generation and transmission systems.
3.Civil engineering involves the construction, construction, maintenance and inspection of major infrastructure projects such as highways, railways, bridges, tunnels, dams and airports.
4.Aviation engineering involves the design, production and testing of aircraft and aircraft design and components and materials such as aerospace, power plants, control and control systems, electrical and electronic systems, and communications and transmission systems.
5.Nuclear engineering involves the design, production, construction, operation and testing of equipments, systems. It also involves the processes in production, control and detection of nuclear radiation.
6.Civil engineering involves designing, constructing and inspecting load-bearing buildings with those commercial buildings, bridges and industrial infrastructure.
7.Biomedical engineering is the practice of designing systems, equipment and tools used to perform medical work. It involves extensive collaboration with physicians, including physicians, nurses, specialists, therapists and investigators, in order to identify, understand and meet their needs for systems, equipment and devices.
8.Chemical engineering is the practice of designing machinery, systems and processes for cleaning raw materials and mixing, adding chemicals and the use of chemicals to make important products.
9.Computer engineering is the practice of designing computer components, computers, networks and computer software.
10.Industrial engineering is the practice of designing and building facilities, machinery, systems and processes, processing of materials, and any number of other workplaces.
11.Environmental engineering is the practice of preventing, reducing and eliminating pollutants that affect air, water and land. It also includes finding and measuring land pollution levels, cleaning and rehabilitating polluted sites and ensuring compliance with local, state and financial policies.

Curiosity, creativity, and empathy aren’t unruly traits that have to be reined-in to make sure success. The human touch has never been more essential within the workplace than it's today. You don’t need to mask your true identity to get paid for your strengths. You don’t get to apologize for the supposedly impractical classes you took in college or the so-called soft skills you've acquired. The job market is quietly creating thousands of openings every week for people that can bring a humanist’s grace to our rapidly evolving high-tech future.
The more we continue with the routine stuff, the more we create a continuous low-level hum of digital connectivity, the more we get tied up within the vastness and blind spots of big data, the more essential it's to bring human judgment into the junctions of our digital lives. Yet, while popularity in areas like economics or neuroscience continues to grow, interest in humanistic topics is moving even as quickly within the other way. Many of the defenders of humanities emphasize the practical value of studying humanities discipline and their arguments are good ones. Recent studies show how employers seek graduates who can think critically and write both by-products of studying the humanities.
Nevertheless, while there seems to be little problem defining or identifying fields in the areas of science and technology, both supporters and detractors of the humanities have difficulty defining the humanities or agreeing on a definition that encompasses them all.
Through studying the humanities, one has the opportunity to get to know one and others better, the opportunity to become better in understanding and grapple with complex moral issues, the complexities and intricacies of humanity.
When you take courses in any humanities discipline, you're using different methods to find out about individuals, including yourself, and groups of peoples. You examine relationships and feelings, the feelings of others, as well as your own feelings. You develop empathy and an appreciation for others which will help address difficult situations, personal and professional.
The ability to process information and to affect difficult situations is vital to everyone just to urge through lifestyle . It is also important for helping to affect contemporary global issues at local, national, and international levels.
Studying humanities involves moving beyond the search for the immediate and pragmatic; it opens one to the examination of the entirety of the human condition and encourages one to grapple with complex moral issues ever-present in life. It encourages reflection and provides one with an appreciation and empathy for humanity. This is why critical thinking wiped out the humanities goes beyond problem solving.

One of the most rewarding things about human experience is our ability to communicate with others. Being able to communicate with someone in his/her own language is a wonderful gift. Knowing the language makes you local wherever you are, opening your world literally and figuratively. It will be built by communities. You will make friends for life. And for these reasons alone, you will see the rewards of learning languages for many years to come.
The many tangible benefits of language learning are undeniable. People who speak more than one language have improved memory power, emphasis, multitasking ability, better listening skills, problem solving and critical thinking skills. They switch between competitive activities and look for changes in their environment more easily than monolinguals, and show signs of great potential and flexibility. If that is not enough, as we grow older, having two or more languages helps to slow down the aging process and dementia.
Language is a very direct link to other cultures as well. Being able to speak another language reveals us and appreciates the cultural, religious, art and history of the people who speak that language. It promotes greater tolerance, empathy and acceptance. Through recent studies, it shows that children who have learned another language are more open and culturally sensitive. Traveling as a local language speaker can transform a trip abroad. While solo travelers are able to travel to the same destinations, travelers who know more than one language can easily navigate without the bubble of visitors and connect and interact with its people in a way that is often inaccessible to those who do not have a language.
Learning a second language also opens the door to further opportunities for learning or working abroad. Learning a language means setting yourself up as you leave your comfort zone. What is clear is the amazing idea of accomplishing something you will hear when you talk to someone in their native language. Here, at LearnOpad, we have our facilitators who are experienced in various languages and who can teach our learners the best. If you are passionate about learning a new language/ many languages, you’ve got to learn it. In order to learn a new language, you have to be consistent in learning and speaking. Only then, a person will be able to learn a language thoroughly.
We have live sessions and live interactions connecting our facilitators and learners to learn and talk with each other to grow their speaking skills. Connect with us to more about it through LearnOpad.

Mathematics is a creation of human mind that is concerned mainly with ideas, processes and reasoning. It is more than arithmetic, algebra, geometry and also more than trigonometry, statistics and calculus. Mathematics includes all of them. Mathematics is all about the way of thinking and the way of organizing a logical proof. It basically gives an insight into the power of human mind.
Problem-solving is one of the most important factors in our life. Math is one of the most effective ways to increase your analytical thinking. It also helps us to improve our logical thinking. Both this analytical thinking and logical thinking help us to become better problem solvers. In this way, we enhance our ability to solve the problem more effectively. The more we solve mathematics problems, the better we solve the real-life problems.
Analytical thinking develops the ability to investigate and know the truth about the world around us. There are truths that we try to look for and that are based on the evidence and not on the emotions.
Math makes us to think and reason clearly, logically and also takes into account real data and that can be verified.
There is no profession in the world that doesn’t use math. We know that mathematicians and scientists rely on mathematical principles to perform their basic work. Engineers also use math to perform their daily tasks. From blue-collar factory workers to the managerial level white-collar professionals, everyone uses math in their work. The use of math may vary for them; likewise, the blue-collar workers use the basic arithmetic to operate efficiently in the assembly lines. On the other hand, blue-collar professionals use advanced math to make managerial decisions. The importance of mathematics also becomes crucial in the time of salary getting paid to the employees.
Do you know that everything in nature is based on math? Even the math offers us the golden ratio formula, which allows us to get the beauty of anything. If you want to judge the beauty of something, then you can perform the golden ration on that thing to declare it beautiful or not. Apart from that, you can also find the mathematical figure in the real world, likewise the hexagonal bee combs, spider webs, Triangle Mountains, and many more. Every single part of nature is based on math. You can also put the math calculation to understand nature creations.

Everything around us uses energy in some way. Our cars, airplanes, and trains burn fuel, our computers need power supplies and Wi-Fi connections, and our telecommunications devices run on mobile signals. In fact, with our expanded capabilities, there has been an increased need for new energy sources; and this could be nuclear power or other energy sources such as fossil energy or hybrid energy.
When we study and discuss physics, we focus more on energy, the basic foundation of science. To understand this connection better, it helps to refer to a stronger definition of physics, ‘Science in which issues are discussed and forces are both separate and integrated and a detailed description of the workings of physics can be: Natural science, or natural sciences, dealing with the laws and structures of matter and the great forces at work in them’. Typically, physics focuses on the force that influences an object, namely, gravity, heat, light, magnetic field, electricity, and others.
Physics uses elements from other branches of science, biology and chemistry for example, has a reputation for being more complex than other sciences. Physics which is in contrast with the philosophy of nature (which was organized until the 19th century) relied on scientific methods to explain the natural world. To understand the basic principles of the universe, physics uses many applications from other natural sciences. As a result of this leap, phenomena studied in physics (energy conservation for example) is common in all material systems. The specific methods in which energy works (hence, physics) are often referred to as ‘the laws of physics’ because every biology of natural sciences, chemistry, geology, material science, medicine, engineering, etc., works and systems that adhere to the laws of physics, physics is sometimes called ‘the basic science’. For example, how physics laws work in all other sciences, consider chemistry, the science atomic molecules and molecules, are compatible and the ideas of quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism to produce chemical compounds.
Overall, physics is closely related to mathematics, for it provides a logical structure in which the laws of nature can be made and their predictions are limited. Many definitions, types, and subjects are presented using punctuation and formulas. The main difference between physics and mathematics is that ultimately physics affects the meanings of the world while mathematics focuses on logical patterns that may extend beyond the real world.

Being a skilled and effective teacher is one of the most important resources in any educational institution. The educator is regarded as a competent agent and a person responsible for the learning process; he/she is responsible for making or helping students learn and benefit or suffer from the quality of his teaching. Given this, the teacher and the quality of his teaching are constantly discussed.
Nowadays, educational institutions around the world are at risk when it comes to dealing with a situation where our educational systems fail to teach and build the best students. Because of such concerns, there is often a continuing need for education to ensure effective teaching for students in all grades. The call today is teacher assessment procedures as a way to provide assurance in teaching / learning processes. Teachers often come to their jobs as teachers who are not trained by law or by experience.
Lack of professional training and teacher development can be a major source of any dissatisfaction with their teaching quality to build competent students with the necessary knowledge and skills in a variety of subject matters. Today, there is a need for shift from traditional teaching to a system of thought-based teaching to research-based teaching that informs and emphasizes teaching practices. This is said to have a profound effect on education which shows that teachers need to keep in touch with researchers in order to develop future teaching skills and incorporate new research findings into their teaching activities to improve closeness and ensure quality teaching. Teacher training and professional development are the necessary ingredients to support new and beneficial teaching. The purpose of the current research paper is to discuss the fundamental importance of teacher training and technological advancement in making and / or enhancing the quality of education in the Algerian context. Some useful ways to assess and enhance the quality of teaching for teachers will also be suggested by showing the findings of the study.
We study the effects of different types of education and training on teacher productivity in promoting student achievement. Previous research in this regard has been hampered by inadequate teacher training practices and difficulties in dealing with illegal and teacher-teacher appointments. We address these issues by measuring models that include detailed pre-training steps and service activity, a rich set of various covariates, and student, teacher, and standardized school outcomes. We find that teacher productivity in primary and secondary schools increases with experience. The greatest gains made happen in the first few years, but we are reaping the benefits of more than five years of teacher education.
On the contrary, we do not find a consistent relationship between formal training for productivity development and teacher productivity. However, this can be driven by part of the assumptions as we obtain the best visible results of systematic training in a combination of the grade range where the estimates should be more accurate.
